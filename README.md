Important:
Before running the application, please make sure to:

Open PowerShell as a normal user and run the following command to enable script execution:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

In your Electron project files, make sure to import the necessary libraries at the top of your main script file like this:

    const { app, BrowserWindow, ipcMain, Menu } = require("electron");
    const { exec } = require("child_process");
    const path = require("path");

This will ensure the application has the required permissions and dependencies to run properly.
